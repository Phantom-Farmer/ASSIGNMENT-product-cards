      <p class="card-text">Never in the history of guitars has there ever been a more sound worthy guitar than that for which the desriptor "acoustic" was given. It can not and should not ever be argued that this kind of guitar was not made for noise making. It was practically named after the study of sound. There are so many sounds being made, and in case you are wondering, it is possible that all matter in the universe is shaped and held by naoacoustics, so you might as well go ahead and buy at least twenty of these badboys.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Parlor guitars are small. They are small enough to fit in most closets, and even jammed parlor closets. Parlors often have coat closets in them, and a little known fact is that parlor closets used to be known for storing little guitars just as much as being used for storing coats or jackets or even scarves. If we in the instrument business were willing to be transparent and honest with our customers, we would officially change the name of this style of guitar to closet guitar, or parlor closet guitar even though it makes the product sound less consequential and a lot more boring. But one thing I can say is that there are usually at least 3 closets in the average family home. If you are friends with at least 7 friends who have family homes, and you care about your friends enough to want them to have petite stringed instruments in their closets, we sincerely hope that you will take advantage of our "20 or more" deal and get these jokers stored in small dark storage rooms maintained by your closest friends.</p>

You could purchase twenty or more and get a fantastic deal, and as a bonus, you can likely carry all of them to your car in one trip, because they are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo tiny.</p>
